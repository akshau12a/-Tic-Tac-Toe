# Updated explanation text for the Tic Tac Toe game code
"""
This interactive Tic Tac Toe game is designed using Python's Tkinter library. 
It includes a player versus computer mode and features animations, game state saving, and an intuitive graphical interface.

Here's how the program works:

1. **Game Initialization**: 
   The game starts by loading a saved state, if available, from a file named game_state.txt. 
   If no saved state exists, a fresh 3x3 game board is initialized.

2. **Player Interaction**:
   The user, playing as Player 1, makes a move by clicking on one of the empty cells. 
   The button changes to show an X, and an animation highlights the action.

3. **Computer's Turn**:
   Once the player completes their move, the computer plays automatically. 
   It selects a random empty cell, places an O, and checks for a winner or a draw.

4. **Winner or Draw Detection**:
   After every move, the program checks if a player has won by aligning three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
   If no moves are left and no one wins, the game declares a draw.

5. **Game State Management**:
   Players can save their progress at any time using the Save and Exit button. 
   The game state, including the board and current turn, is stored in game_state.txt.

6. **GUI Design**:
   The interface is built with Tkinter, featuring styled buttons, labels, and dynamic animations. 
   Colors and themes make the game visually appealing, with smooth transitions.

7. **Enhanced Features**:
   The program prevents invalid moves, like selecting an already occupied cell. 
   The game also notifies the user of any mistakes with helpful messages.

This project combines Python's GUI capabilities with logical game flow, creating an engaging Tic Tac Toe experience.
